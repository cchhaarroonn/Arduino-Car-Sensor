# Car Sensor using Arduino Uno and HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor

This project implements a car sensor using an Arduino Uno, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, LED, and piezo buzzer. The sensor detects the distance between the car and any object behind (of any material doesn't have to be only metal) it and provides visual and audible warnings if the car gets too close to an obstacle.
